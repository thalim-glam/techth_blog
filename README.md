## Description
- The purpose of this challenge was to enhance skills regarding working with Express.js API and configure it to use Sequelize to interact with MySQL database (for my app the database name is "ecommerce_db"). This was node command line based application which used dotenv and nodemon and Insomnia to view, update or delete existing database tables.

  - [1] Click this repository link to get the app: https://github.com/thalim-glam/myEcommerceORM 
  - [2] Clone the repository or download the zip folder.
  - [3] Open the source code in your code editor.
  - [4] Open the integrated terminal or git bash to test the application.
  - [5] Please refer to [Tests](#tests) section for further information regarding testing.

## Required Task 

- The frontend is included in the starter code
- Student HW is to build the back end, connect the two, and then deploy the entire application to Heroku.
- User Story 
```
AS A manager at an internet retail company
I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies
```
- Acceptance criteria
```
GIVEN a functional Express.js API
WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
```

## User Instruction

  - Start git bash or Terminal and navigate to the application.
  - If cannot find JSON file, please type "npm init -y".
  - Naviagate to the db folder and open integrated terminal.
  - Type "mysql -u root -p" to connect to db.
  - Source schema.sql and quit from mysql.
  - Type "npm run seed" to help seed populate the database
